# ML-Movie-recommender-system

This project implements a Content-Based Movie Recommendation System using the TMDB 5000 movies dataset. The model recommends movies based on the similarity of features such as genres, keywords, cast, crew, and the movie overview.

## Project Overview
In this project, I created a movie recommendation engine using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and cosine similarity. The main goal is to recommend movies that are similar to the one a user likes based on the content of the movie.
